# Steeltoe .NET Framework on Cloud Foundry Windows

This C# project targets .NET Framework 4.6.1 for Windows and is intended to be pushed to a [Cloud Foundry](https://cloudfoundry.org) platform. Using the Visual Studio MVC template as a base, the code has been simplified to host a few RESTful endpoints. Steeltoe packages like management and logging have been added to aid in streaming logs and managing the app. A cf manifest is also provided for easy deployment to Cloud Foundry.
