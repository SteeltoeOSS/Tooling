Application and Service Autodetection

  Application Autodetection

    Name
      The application name is determined, in order of precedence:
      *  The value of the –-name option
      *  The output directory name if the output directory contains the file <name>.csproj
      *  The file name <name>.csproj if the output directory contains one and only file with extension .csproj
      If none of the above is satisfied, an error occurs.

    Framework
      The application framework is determined, in order of precedence:
      *  The value of the  –-framework option
      *  The value of the <TargetFramework> element in the project .csproj file
      *  The first framework listed in the <TargetFrameworks> element in the project .csproj file
      If none of the above is satisfied, an error occurs.

  Service Autodetection
      Services are autodetected by searching a project’s .csproj file for the presence of any of a service’s dependencies.
      A dependency is considered present if any of the .csproj file elements matches one of the following XPath expressions:
          /Project/ItemGroup/PackageReference[@Include='<dep>']
          /Project/ItemGroup/Reference[@Include='<dep>']

      Examples:
      * A project with a dependency on RabbitMQ:
          <Project>
            <ItemGroup>
              <PackageReference Include="RabbitMQ.Client" />
            </ItemGroup>
          </Project>

      * A project with a dependency on GemFire:
          <Project>
            <ItemGroup>
              <Reference Include="Pivotal.GemFire" />
            </ItemGroup>
          </Project>
